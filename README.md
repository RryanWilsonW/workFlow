# workFlow
Work Flow is a website designed for someone who is working the old fashioned 9 to 5 job. When the user opens the website they are given the current date at the top of the page. The website contains 8 colums that contain the time, imput fields for todo information, and save icons. The rows are then color coordinated to indicate if the todo is in the past(grey), present(red), or future(green). When the save icon is pressed, the todo is saved in its spot. If the user refreshes the page, it will still be in its correct spot.
